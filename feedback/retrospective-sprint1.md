## Retrospective Report on Sprint 1

#### Do you think the lectures are helpful to understand the goals of the sprint and to do the exercises?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### Do you think the Pluralsight videos are helpful to do the proposed exercises?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### Are the proposed exercises (mock tests, programming exercises) helping you to learn the materials in preparation for the test?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### Keeping in mind that you should invest around 11 hours/week in this module, has the amount of work been manageable until now?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### Do you find the structure of the module resources on Blackboard/GitHub sufficiently clear?

**Comments received:**

* *I do find Blackboard easy to navigate however GitHub is a bit overwhelming as I feel like I am missing certain information/folders as they're not grouped as well as I'd like. (I'm not sure if this is just an initial problem that I will overcome in the future the more I get used to it)*

**Response:**

Thank you for the observation. If this is of general concern, please discuss changes to the current structure of the resources on GitHub with your course rep. Once consensus on this matter is reached among students, the course rep should send the proposal to the module convenor (<a href="mailto:ab373@le.ac.uk">send email to Artur</a>) and the proposal will be implemented.

#### Have you received enough support from the lecturer when it was required?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### Have you received enough support from the TAs when it was required?

**Comments received:**

*100% Yes*

#### START DOING

**Comments received:**

* *Perhaps some class exam questions based on the lecture will be an ideal way to test what we have learnt during the lecture and to conclude what we have done.*

**Response:**

Thank you for the proposal. Some questions will be introduced at the end of, or during, the lectures using Participoll as done in the revision session.

**Comments received:**

* *Pluralsight is great but I'd like if the learning checks were more extensive and catered to what learn in the Pluralsight course.*

**Response:**

Thank you for the observation. The learning checks on Pluralsight cannot be changed. However, some more specific quizzes will be made available through Blackboard. Depending on timing constraints, this may be implemented for sprint 2 or not - I'm attending a conference on software engineering in Vancouver next week - but the quizzes will be there for sprints 3 and 4.  


#### STOP doing...

**Comments received:**

*Having to enter T or F during the test is very stressful since I end up spending a considerable amount of time triple-checking that I've input T or F and if I've input them in the right box. Perhaps if there was a different way to input like radio buttons or having us enter the number of the statements that we think are true.*

**Response:**

Thank you for the observation. We will consider it for the final test although in that test questions will be more varied, involving short answer questions, multiple choice and programming exercises. 

Note that, in case of occasional syntactical mistakes in your answers in test 1, you can send me an email. For example, there was a student who answered `T'` instead of `T` and the answer was considered valid once the error was spotted.

  

#### CONTINUE doing...

**Comments received:**

* *The use of current tech is very interesting and useful. The Github is incredibly useful.* 
* *The structure of the module is great. Lectures, videos, exercises and labs works for me.*

**Response:**

We are glad to hear those comments!
