## FEEDBACK FORM: MINIPROJECT SPRINT 2 (CHECKPOINT)

### Section 1: How and when was feedback provided?

Feedback was released on 27 November 2017 by email and on this feedback form.

###Â Section 2: General Feedback

The goal of the feedback received is to provide an early indication of your current level of engagement with the module. This checkpoint has a low share of your mini project mark.

The release deadline for the miniproject is approaching fast: **by the end of Wednesday 1st November** (strict: 2 Nov, 9am).

Some students copied the skeleton of the web application in the wrong folder. It should be under `sprint2/miniproject/`. 

**Copying software artifacts in the right location** is very important when developing software systems. For example:
* If you place your JSP files outside the folder `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`, the Spring Framework will not know where to find your views unless you provide a custom configuration. 
* If you place your Java files outside the folder `src/main/java`, Gradle will not know what Java classes to compile. 

This applies to a wide myriad of situations in software development, ranging from configuration scenarios to deployment scenarios, where PaaS (like Heroku) are used.
