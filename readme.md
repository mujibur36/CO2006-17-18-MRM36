The **study guide** is available [here](./CO2006-studyguide-17-18.pdf).

The **schedule of sessions and deadlines** can be found [in this Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3jq8vu82rbs202guelkuo5q2sg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London) 
  * [This is the iCal link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/3jq8vu82rbs202guelkuo5q2sg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to the calendar in case you want to import it in your calendar app). 
  * Note that there are some variations with respect to the information available in the University personalized timetable, such as the inclusion of coursework deadlines, and the **official schedule for CO2006** is the one in the calendar.

The handouts of the introduction lecture are available [here](./L01_handouts.pdf).

## Module Structure 

The module is split in four main [sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint) and each sprint has a goal (an assessed component):

| Sprint Goal | Assessed component | Marks | Weight |
|--|--|--|--|
| [1. Agile, Groovy, Gradle](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint1) | [Test](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint1#the-sprint-goal-assessed-coursework) | 100 | 15% |
| [2. Spring MVC: business logic and validation](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint2) | [Mini project](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint2#the-sprint-goal-assessed-coursework) | 100 | 20% |
| [3. Quality Assurance: test-driven development](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint3) | [Mini project](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint3#the-sprint-goal-assessed-coursework) | 100 | 20% |
| [4. Persistence and security](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint4) | [Mini project](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint4#the-sprint-goal-assessed-coursework) | 100 | 20% |
|  | [Final test](https://github.com/uol-inf/CO2006-17-18/tree/master/sprint4#final-test-assessed-coursework)  | 100 | 25% |
 

Sprints are structured in weeks, which are in turn structured as follows:
* **lecture**: introduction to key notions and resources for the week
* **weekly tasks** to reinforce and expand knowledge 
  * **what to focus on?** weekly tasks 
  * **resources**
    * Pluralsight videos
    * exercises
  * **learning check**: solutions to exercises
* **monitoring checkpoint**: usually one week preceding a release deadline (mini project) 
  * these are to be used as internal milestones for you to control your progress in an agile way: small increments of the mini project
  * the idea is to **avoid a hurried big bang of work** in the last few days before the actual deadline (release deadline)
* **release**: submission of a piece of coursework at the end of the sprint using GitHub (for sprints 2, 3 and 4)
* **questions**
  * during the week: 
    * on the discussion board on Blackboard
    * office hours (convenor/help desk with TAs)
  * on Monday's lab session


## Lab sessions and formative coursework
* Groups for lab sessions

| Time | Group | Members |
|--|--|--|
| Monday, 12:00 | A | [Group A](./groupA.md) |
| Monday, 16:00 | B | [Group B](./groupB.md) |

* **Formative coursework** consists of exercises that are going to be uploaded to the main GitHub repository (`CO2006-17-18`) each week.
  * We recommend to work on your solutions before going to the lab session in order to reinforce the knowledge that you are learning from lectures and Pluralsight resources. 
  * Exercise solutions will be posted by the end of Monday/early Tuesday in order to compare your solution with the proposed one.
  * In order to give an idea of the level of effort required for each exercise, exercises are tagged with a level of difficulty as follows:
    * :star: : the solution follows from the resources given (lectures, videos, examples)   
    * :star::star: : the solution may require browsing documentation in order to solve the problem 
    * :star::star::star: the solution involves some challenge and it is likely that you will need to combine solutions from different units in order to solve the problem

* We recommend the use of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) in lab sessions. 
  * That is, we recommend to work in pairs during the lab session to solve the exercises proposed for the corresponding week for pedagogical reasons. 
  * However, this is optional and you may prefer to work on the exercises on your own at your own pace.
  * Please use this [link](https://goo.gl/forms/LeObdCfaDqOaZAN73) to indicate 
    * if you are working in a pair and who is your mate; or
    * if you prefer to work alone.
  * Bear in mind that **assessed coursework is individual** and you **MUST NOT** discuss the worksheets (sprints 2,3 and 4) with anyone else. 

## IDE and Tooling
